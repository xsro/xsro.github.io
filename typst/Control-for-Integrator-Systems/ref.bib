abstract = {Several sufficient stability conditions exist for the super-twisting algorithm. For its tuning in practical applications, however, a popular parameter set is regularly used, which is provided in literature without any stability proof. This short note provides a novel, simple sufficient stability condition which includes this very popular parameter setting.}

  abstract = {Prescribed-time (PT) control for nonlinear systems, originated from Song et al., has gained increasing attention among the control community. The salient feature of PT con突出的 trol lies in its ability to achieve system stability within a finite settling time user-assignable in advance irrespective of initial conditions. It is such a unique feature that has enticed many follow-up studies on this technically important area, motivating numerous research advancements. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on the recent developments in PT control. Through a concise introduction to the concept of PT control, and a unique taxonomy covering: 1) from robust PT control to adaptive PT control; 2) from PT control for single-input–single-output (SISO) systems to multi-input–multioutput (MIMO) systems; and 3) from PT control for an isolated system to multiagent systems, we present an accessible review of this interesting topic. We highlight key techniques, and fundamental assumptions adopted in various developments as well as some new design ideas. We also discuss several possible future research directions toward PT control.},

  abstract = {This article has presented an introductory tutorial on discontinuous dynamical systems. Various examples illustrate the pertinence of the continuity and Lipschitzness properties that guarantee the existence and uniqueness of classical solutions to ordinary differential equations. The lack of these properties in examples drawn from various disciplines motivates the need for more general notions than the classical one. First, we introduced notions of solution for discontinuous systems. Second, we reviewed the available tools from non- smooth analysis to study the gradient information of candidate Lyapunov functions. And, third, we presented nonsmooth stability tools to characterize the asymptotic behavior of solutions.},
