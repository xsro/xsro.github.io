  abstract = {In this note, we present a new continuous control mechanism that compensates for uncertainty in a class of high-order, multiple-input{\textendash}multiple-output nonlinear systems. The control strategy is based on limited assumptions on the structure of the system nonlinearities. A new Lyapunov-based stability argument is employed to prove semiglobal asymptotic tracking.},
