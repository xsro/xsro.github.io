# Printable & External Resources 


## [nlct](nlct.pdf)

(updated 2023-09-22, work in progress) : 
This is a printable version of the notes for the course *Nonlinear Systems and Control*.
It includes some additional material, such as mathematics for control like differential geometry, and some solutions for the ref74(khalil's nonlinear systems 3rd edition).
I originally collect this to provide a supplement for the course, 
but it is not yet complete.
